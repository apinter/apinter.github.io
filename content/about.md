# whoami 

My name is Attila Pinter. I've been into computers since I was 6 years old. I got deep into Linux when I was 14, fast forward to today and Linux is what I make a living with. Been studying IT in my younger years, but schools were not as great at teaching or knowledge transfer as the community is. I did spent a month at university - which I got into with full scholarship -, but considered it a waste of my time and bailed.   
Since that I've been working on: 

* IoT devices - before they were called IoT - hardware design, test, assembly and support, 
* Smart city projects - before they were called smart cities -,  
* Big data projects - before it was called Big Data -,
* Countless security and retail projects involving distributed video content analysis,
* Face detection and recognition projects,
* Hundreds of hours of consultation work for small and large companies,

My field of expertise are in interoperability, servicing, IT automation and infrastructure, collaboration. I guess in today's terms  I would be called a DevOps engineer.
In the past few years been working on a hybrid cloud solution integrating ~60 different cloud providers with our on-premise storage servers at [OpenStorage.io](https://openstorage.io) as the CTO.
