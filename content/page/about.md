# whoami 

My name is Attila Pinter. I've been into computers since I was 6 years old. I got deep into Linux when I was 14, fast forward to today, and Linux is what I make a living with. Been studying IT in my younger years, but schools were not nearly as good at teaching or knowledge transfer as the community is.
Since that I've been working on: 

* IoT devices - hardware design, test, assembly and support, 
* Smart city projects,  
* Big data projects,
* Countless security and retail projects involving distributed video content analysis,
* Face detection and recognition projects,
* Hundreds of hours of consultation work for small and large companies,

My field of expertise are in interoperability, cloud services, IT automation and infrastructure, collaboration.
