My talk took place at  openSUSE.Asia Virtual Summit 2021 August 08, 2021. During this talk I was sharing some information as how we at OpenStorage.io are utilizing GitlabCI, Ansible and MicroOS to achive some DevOpsie automation to make our life a lot easier. Enjoy! (click pic)

Note: The pipeline has a bug cause I mixed `zypper` and `apt`, but it is fixed in the slides in [my Github repo](https://github.com/apinter/oSAVS21-microOS)
