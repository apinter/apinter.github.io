tldr: First entry on this blog explaining what technical greatness will be shared here by yours truly. This series is more of a collection of tools, references and practices for me. If you find something useful feel free to use it.

## Purpose 

First of all this a GNU/Linux - and mostly openSUSE - focused technical blog with a bunch of know-how, tools, personal recommendations. Recently had this realization that the content I'm keeping in my QOwnNotes would be a little bit more valuable if...

* ..it would be available publicly,
* ..it would be DDG/Google searchable,
* ..I could just link to it when I'm helping others AkA "laziness".

Being active in different communities, I run into a lot of repeated questions. How to do this, how to do that, what would be an ideal setup for *xyz*. So instead of searching for the answer in **QOwnNotes** or in the messaging history I could just send a link to the corresponding entry here. 

However, this first post serves a few purpose. First it is explaining in a nutshell what is **YAL/TB** about. Secondly, this very page will contain a list below from wich I will pick subjects to write about in a bit more detail and will change that list as well to provide me with a clear guide of what I want to put here. Lastly, I **desperately** need to practice technical writing or writing in general.
