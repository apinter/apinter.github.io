<p>My name is Attila Pinter. I&rsquo;ve been into computers since I was 6 years old. I got deep into Linux when I was 14, fast forward to today and Linux is what I make a living with. Been studying IT in my younger years, but schools were not as great at teaching or knowledge transfer as the community is. I did spent a month at university - which I got into with full scholarship -, but considered it a waste of my time and bailed.<br>
Since that I&rsquo;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>IoT devices - before they were called IoT - hardware design, test, assembly and support,</li>
<li>Smart city projects - before they were called smart cities -,</li>
<li>Big data projects - before it was called Big Data -,</li>
<li>Countless security and retail projects involving distributed video content analysis,</li>
<li>Face detection and recognition projects,</li>
<li>Hundreds of hours of consultation work for small and large companies,</li>
</ul>
<p>My field of expertise are in interoperability, cloud services, IT automation and infrastructure, collaboration. I guess in today&rsquo;s terms  I would be called a DevOps engineer.
In the past few years been working on a hybrid cloud solution integrating ~60 different cloud providers with our on-premise storage servers at <a href="https://openstorage.io">OpenStorage.io</a> as the CTO.</p>
