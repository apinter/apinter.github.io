&lt;p&gt;My name is Attila Pinter. I&amp;rsquo;ve been into computers since I was 6 years old. I got deep into Linux when I was 14, fast forward to today, and Linux is what I make a living with. Been studying IT in my younger years, but schools were not nearly as good at teaching or knowledge transfer as the community is.
Since that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IoT devices - hardware design, test, assembly and support,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smart city projects,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big data projects,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Countless security and retail projects involving distributed video content analysis,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Face detection and recognition projects,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hundreds of hours of consultation work for small and large companies,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My field of expertise are in interoperability, cloud services, IT automation and infrastructure, collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
