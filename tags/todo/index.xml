      <description>Purpose First of all this a GNU/Linux - and mostly openSUSE - focused technical blog with a bunch of know-how, tools, personal recommendations. Recently had this realization that the content I&amp;rsquo;m keeping in my QOwnNotes would be a little bit more valuable if&amp;hellip;
..it would be available publicly, ..it would be DDG/Google searchable, ..I could just link to it when I&amp;rsquo;m helping others AkA &amp;ldquo;laziness&amp;rdquo;. Being active in different communities, I run into a lot of repeated questions.</description>
