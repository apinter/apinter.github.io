      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-started&#34;&gt;Getting started&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By now you&amp;rsquo;re probably familiar with &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;. Git is a popular distributed version control system with which people can collaborate on pretty much anything that you can/want to version control and collaborate on. This can be source code, documentation, automation scripts, anything really. To work on a project with others, one would generally create a fork of the main repository where the code, it&amp;rsquo;s branches and issues are being stored at. This short article explains what to do when the upstream project pulls too far ahead that it leaves your fork out-of-date creating potential issues during a pull request (PR) which would have to be resolved by the person who the PR is assigned to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
