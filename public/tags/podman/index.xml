      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;podman-checkpointrestore-in-userspace&#34;&gt;Podman Checkpoint/Restore in Userspace&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently I was migrating our entire Podman infra to a new, bigger server, roughly ~180 container. Most of our things are running in &lt;code&gt;pods&lt;/code&gt; which are fairly easy to migrate, just &lt;code&gt;podman generate kube --filename xyz.yml xyz-pod&lt;/code&gt;, clean up the yml a bit and on the new server I just &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; it with &lt;code&gt;podman play xyz.yml&lt;/code&gt;. Done, pod migrated.&#xA;On the other hand we have a few containers that are running outside of pods and was interested how lazy I can get with those using Podman. Fairly quickly ran into &lt;code&gt;Podman Checkpoints/Restore in Userspace (CRIU)&lt;/code&gt;.&#xA;With CRIU Podman is able to checkpoint and restore containers in their &lt;strong&gt;current state&lt;/strong&gt;. Migration is just one use-case, another would be to restore a container after a host reboot exactly the way it was prior the restart. This is exactly what I needed, scripts back in the box, in the new and shiny stuff comes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-podman&#34;&gt;What is Podman&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Podman is a a daemonless, open-source tool to manage, deploy and build application containers. Podman is using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and container images, which means that containers crated with/for Docker or CRI-o will work with Podman as well and vice versa. It is coming with a command line interface (CLI) which offers pretty much the same commands like Docker does. How similar are Podman commands to Docker&amp;rsquo;s? Let&amp;rsquo;s put it this way: many Podman users just alias &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;podman&lt;/code&gt;. Like other runtimes, Podman also relies on an OCI compliant container runtime to interface with the operating system. Podamn also has a RESTful API to manage containers, offers automatic updates of containers and has a fantastic &lt;code&gt;systemd&lt;/code&gt; integration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
