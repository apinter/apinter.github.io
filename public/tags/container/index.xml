      <description>Podman Checkpoint/Restore in Userspace Recently I was migrating our entire Podman infra to a new, bigger server, roughly ~180 container. Most of our things are running in pods which are fairly easy to migrate, just podman generate kube --filename xyz.yml xyz-pod, clean up the yml a bit and on the new server I just play it with podman play xyz.yml. Done, pod migrated. On the other hand we have a few containers that are running outside of pods and was interested how lazy I can get with those using Podman.</description>

      <description>What is Podman Podman is a a daemonless, open-source tool to manage, deploy and build application containers. Podman is using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and container images, which means that containers crated with/for Docker or CRI-o will work with Podman as well and vice versa. It is coming with a command line interface (CLI) which offers pretty much the same commands like Docker does. How similar are Podman commands to Docker&amp;rsquo;s?</description>
